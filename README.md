# BotPlat form

A ruby based Bot platform to let developers to focus on bot's business logic. You can connect your bot to channels such as slack, teams, lineworks, chatwork and etc with only a few steps while the bot's logic is the same. check the [supported bot channels](https://github.com/lifevar/bot-platform/blob/main/docs/channels.md#supported).

We also provide CLI(also as a channel) to accelerate the test and demo processes.
